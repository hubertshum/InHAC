Interaction-based Human Activity Comparison (InHAC)

We present the InHAC datasets for human-human and human-object interaction, as described in the paper Interaction-based Human Activity Comparison (http://hubertshum.com/pbl_tvcg2020interaction.htm). The data is in the BVH skeleton motion format. The following datasets are included:
- InHAC-2C: Character to character kick-boxing interaction
- InHAC-CRC: Character to retargeted character kick-boxing interaction
- InHAC-HOI: Human to object interaction
- InHAC-2PB: Two people boxing interaction
- InHAC-2PD: Two people daily movement interaction
