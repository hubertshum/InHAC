# InHAC: Interaction-based Human Activity Comparison

![teaser](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77708790/146571925-dc3b1e8c-d7dd-42e9-9103-1aa4e0bd5c5d.png)

<p>We present the InHAC datasets for human-human and human-object interaction, as described in the paper <a href="http://hubertshum.com/pbl_tvcg2020interaction.htm">Interaction-based Human Activity Comparison</a>. The data is in the BVH skeleton motion format. The following datasets are included:</p>
<ul>
  <li>InHAC-2C: Character to character kick-boxing interaction</li>
<li>InHAC-CRC: Character to retargeted (i.e. adjusted size) character kick-boxing interaction</li>
<li>InHAC-HOI: Human to object interaction</li>
<li>InHAC-2PB: Two people boxing interaction</li>
<li>InHAC-2PD: Two people daily movement interaction</li>
</ul>
