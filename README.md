# InHAC: Interaction-based Human Activity Comparison Datasets

![teaser](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77708790/146571925-dc3b1e8c-d7dd-42e9-9103-1aa4e0bd5c5d.png)

<p>We present the InHAC datasets for human-human and human-object interaction, as described in the paper <a href="http://hubertshum.com/pbl_tvcg2020interaction.htm">Interaction-based Human Activity Comparison</a>. InHAC includes 5 datasets of different natures with over 450 3D skeletal motion data in BVH/TRC formats. They are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>InHAC-2C</b>: Character to character kick-boxing interaction</li>
<li><b>InHAC-CRC</b>: Character to retargeted (i.e. adjusted size) character kick-boxing interaction</li>
<li><b>InHAC-HOI</b>: Human to object interaction</li>
<li><b>InHAC-2PB</b>: Two people boxing interaction</li>
<li><b>InHAC-2PD</b>: Two people daily movement interaction</li>
</ul>

The motion data can be visualised using Autodesk MotionBuilder. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtv0q3KQ5a9rKTl3v4qwmTY2VaXemwPu8">YouTube tutorials</a> are available.
